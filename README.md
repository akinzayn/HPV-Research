# HPV-Research

- I analyzed the 2014-2015 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data to determine the effect of arsenic in high and low-risk HPV in the male sample using R- programming language.
- Performed hypothesis tests and statistical tests such as the Chi-Square test to determine if there is an association between the categorical variables and the high and low-risk HPV.  Studentâ€™s t-test to determine if there is at least a difference in the means of negative and positive HPV. Non-Parametric Anova, and post hoc tests.
